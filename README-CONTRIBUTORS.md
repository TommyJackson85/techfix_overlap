# Contributions (not finished documenting)

Currently looking for contributions in the following areas.

First Priority:
- Documentation reviews
    - Readme Contributors page (this page) - The setup guide for this application is unfinished. For now it is the main priority. Looking for developers to pull this application and try and set up a Django developers environment. Developers may refer to the [Django Setup guide from Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) in the mean time, in trying to set it up. Please highlight noted bugs as issue reports.
    - Main Readme file - To see what we can change or edit. Much of the document is very descriptive and long and could be edited down futher.

Second Priority:
- User feedback, to hear general application usability feedback.
- Code reviews, to analyse the effeciency and clarity of the code.

Feel free to post any noted issues or suggestions in the repository's Issues section.
If it's granted as a valid issue, you may create a PR request.
