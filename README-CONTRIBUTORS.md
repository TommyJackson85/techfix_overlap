# Contributions

Currently looking for contributions in the following areas.

First Priority:
- Documentation reviews
    - Readme Contributors page (this page) - to see if it clarifies how to set up the template in a local environment and to put the prerequisites and setup instructions into practice. If it does not work, this document could be updated to clarify the instructions better.
    - Main Readme file - To see what we can change or edit. Much of the document is very descriptive and long and could be edited down futher.

Second Priority:
- User feedback, to hear general application usability feedback.
- Code reviews, to analyse the effeciency and clarity of the code.

Feel free to post any noted issues or suggestions in the repository's Issues section.
If it's granted as a valid issue, you may create a PR request.
